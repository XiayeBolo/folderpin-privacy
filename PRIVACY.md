# Privacy Policy for FolderPin Pro

**Effective Date: July 23, 2025**  
**Last Updated: July 23, 2025**

## Overview

FolderPin Pro is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our macOS application handles your information and ensures your data remains secure and private.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

FolderPin Pro is designed with privacy in mind. We **do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal information**, including:

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- File contents or file names
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Device information or system specifications
- Location data
- Crash reports or error logs
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## How FolderPin Pro Works

### Local Operation Only
- **100% Local Processing**: All operations are performed entirely on your Mac
- **No Internet Required**: The app functions completely offline
- **No Data Transmission**: No information is sent to external servers
- **No User Accounts**: No registration, login, or user accounts required

### File Access
- **User-Initiated Only**: The app only accesses files and folders that you explicitly select through drag-and-drop or file selection
- **Temporary Access**: File access is limited to the duration of the pinning operation
- **Reversible Changes**: All modifications to file dates can be completely undone
- **Original Data Preserved**: Your original file creation and modification dates are safely stored and can be restored

### Data Storage
- **Local Configuration Only**: The app stores minimal configuration data (your pinned file list and preferences) locally in your Mac's Application Support folder
- **No Cloud Storage**: No data is stored in cloud services or external databases
- **Standard macOS Location**: Configuration files are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/FolderPin Pro/`

## Third-Party Services

FolderPin Pro does not integrate with, connect to, or use any third-party services, including:
- Analytics platforms
- Advertising networks
- Cloud storage services
- Social media platforms
- Crash reporting services

## App Store and Updates

- **App Store Delivery**: Updates are delivered through the Mac App Store's standard update mechanism
- **No Personal Information Required**: Updates do not require or transmit any personal information
- **System-Level Process**: Update checks are handled by macOS, not by our app

## Data Security

Since FolderPin Pro operates entirely on your local device and does not collect or transmit any data:
- **No Network Vulnerabilities**: No risk of data breaches through network transmission
- **Local File Security**: Your file security depends on your Mac's built-in security features
- **No External Attack Surface**: No external servers or databases that could be compromised

## Children's Privacy

FolderPin Pro does not collect any information from users of any age, including children under 13. The app's local-only operation ensures that no personal information is gathered regardless of the user's age.

## International Users

This privacy policy applies to all users worldwide. Since no data leaves your device, your information remains subject only to your local jurisdiction's privacy laws.

## Your Rights and Choices

Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no personal data to:
- Access or review
- Correct or update  
- Delete or remove
- Export or transfer

You maintain complete control over your data as it never leaves your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. When we make changes:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- For material changes, we will notify users through the app or the Mac App Store
- Continued use of FolderPin Pro after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy

## Compliance

This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations, including:
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

Since we do not collect personal information, many regulatory requirements do not apply to our app.
